## **Deployment Guide** üöÄ

To deploy DockWeb with the appropriate credentials, set the required environment variables. You can specify credentials for all extensions at once using `ALL_EMAIL` and `ALL_PASS`, or define them individually as needed.

### **Basic Command (Beginner Friendly)**
```bash
docker run -d \
  --env ALL_EMAIL=<your_email> \
  --env ALL_PASS=<your_password> \
  --env GRASS_USER=<your_email> \
  --env GRASS_PASS=<your_password> \
  --env GRADIENT_EMAIL=<your_email> \
  --env GRADIENT_PASS=<your_password> \
  --env DAWN_EMAIL=<your_email> \
  --env DAWN_PASS=<your_password> \
  --env TENO_EMAIL=<your_email> \
  --env TENO_PASS=<your_password> \
  --volume ./chrome_user_data:/chrome_user_data \
  --publish 5000:5000 \
  carbon2029/dockweb
```

> **Note:** You only need to include the variables for the extensions you plan to use.


> **Tip** This is too difficult for you check this awesome project called [money4band](https://github.com/MRColorR/money4band) for easy app setup

| -p 5000:5000   | Exposes port 5000 for web-based interactions    |

### **Persistent Data Management**
To ensure session continuity across container restarts, DockWeb includes a volume mount for Chrome user data by default. This maps `./chrome_user_data` from the host system to `/app/chrome_user_data` within the container, enabling persistent storage and seamless session restoration.

## **Advanced Usage**

### **1. Pull the Docker Image:**
```bash
docker pull carbon2029/dockweb
```

### **2. Run the Container:**
Run the container while supplying credentials for one or more supported extensions:
```bash
docker run -d --env ALL_EMAIL=<your_email> --env ALL_PASS=<your_password> \
  --volume ./chrome_user_data:/chrome_user_data \
  --publish 5000:5000 carbon2029/dockweb
```

### **3. Monitor the Container:**
To verify if the container is running:
```bash
docker ps
```

### **4. Stop the Container:**
```bash
docker stop <container_id>
```

## **Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)**

### **Is DockWeb lightweight?**
Currently, resource usage is as follows:
- **CPU:** ~0.01 - 1%
- **RAM:** ~522 MB (With 5 apps)

Future updates will focus on further optimizations to reduce resource consumption.

### **Do these extensions generate revenue?**
As of **Feb 9, 2025**, only Grass and Nodepay have successfully distributed an airdrop. Other platforms claim to offer payouts in the future. Users should exercise discretion and only participate if they trust the respective platforms.

### **Will you add more apps?**
Yes...........well it all depends on app and demand for the app I dont wanna spam dockweb with trash apps if you want an app added you can suggest it in issues, I only add the apps that I personally will use cause I am not a fan of coping years for something that may or may not pay you.

## **My Opinions and Vision on the Project**  

As mentioned previously, I am not a fan of waiting years for something that may or may not pay off. So, DockWeb follows a "set it and forget it" ideology, and I will try my best to keep things that way.  

You may ask, why use DockWeb at all? Why not simply install the extension directly on your web browser? Well, yeah, you can, but I am personally skeptical of running unknown extensions in my personal browser. So, I created DockWeb‚Äîand the best part is, it's free to use! üòÉ But remember, it's a personal choice. If you find running apps on your main browser hassle-free, you can always go that route.  

### **Nodepay and Other Captchas**  

Nodepay and Teneo use Cloudflare captcha, which is really hard to bypass. I tried many methods, but all ended in a dead end. So for now, you have to manually enter the cookies. üòï  

But if I find a way to enable auto-login, I‚Äôll be sure to add it! and yeah prs are always welcome :D
