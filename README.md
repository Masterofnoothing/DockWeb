# **DockWeb**

DockWeb is a versatile Docker image designed to run multiple money-making web extensions in a single container. As more Grass-like web extensions are emerging, DockWeb provides an efficient way to manage and deploy them together.

More will be added soon ;) 

## **Deployment Guide ðŸš€**

To instantiate the Docker container with appropriate credentials for web extensions, set the required environment variables. Substitute `<your_email>` and `<your_password>` with your Grass account credentials or those corresponding to other supported extensions:

```bash
docker run -d \
  -e GRASS_USER=<your_email> \
  -e GRASS_PASS=<your_password> \
  -e GRADIENT_EMAIL=<your_email> \
  -e GRADIENT_PASS=<your_password> \
  -v ./chrome_user_data:/chrome_user_data \
  carbon2029/dockweb
```

### **Persistent Data Management**
To maintain browser session continuity across container lifecycle events, a volume mount has been configured. This mechanism ensures the preservation of Chrome user data by mapping `./chrome_user_data` from the host system to `/chrome_user_data` within the containerized environment, thereby enabling persistent storage and seamless session restoration.





## **Advance Usage**

1. **Pull the Docker image:**  
   ```bash
   docker pull carbon2029/dockweb
   ```

2. **Run the container:**  
   Provide credentials for one or more supported extensions as environment variables. For example:  
   ```bash
   docker run -d -e GRASS_USER=<your_email> -e GRASS_PASS=<your_password> carbon2029/dockweb
   ```
 

3. **Monitor the container:**  
   To check if the container is running:  
   ```bash
   docker ps
   ```

4. **Stop the container:**  
   ```bash
   docker stop <container_id>
   ```

As of 11/25/2024 only grass had made their airdrop other are claiming to pay soon Time will tell so only use the apps if you trust them.
