## **Deployment Guide** üöÄ

To deploy DockWeb with the appropriate credentials, set the required environment variables. You can specify credentials for all extensions at once using `ALL_EMAIL` and `ALL_PASS`, or define them individually as needed.

### **Basic Command (Beginner Friendly)**
```bash
docker run -d \
  --env ALL_EMAIL=<your_email> \
  --env ALL_PASS=<your_password> \
  --env GRASS_USER=<your_email> \
  --env GRASS_PASS=<your_password> \
  --env GRADIENT_EMAIL=<your_email> \
  --env GRADIENT_PASS=<your_password> \
  --env DAWN_EMAIL=<your_email> \
  --env DAWN_PASS=<your_password> \
  --env TENO_EMAIL=<your_email> \
  --env TENO_PASS=<your_password> \
  --volume ./chrome_user_data:/chrome_user_data \
  --publish 5000:5000 \
  carbon2029/dockweb
```

> **Note:** You only need to include the variables for the extensions you plan to use.


> **Tip** This is too difficult for you check this awesome project called [money4band](https://github.com/MRColorR/money4band) for easy app setup

### **Supported Environment Variables**

| Variable Name     | Description                                         |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| ALL_EMAIL      | Universal email for all extensions (if same)   |
| ALL_PASS       | Universal password for all extensions (if same) |
| GRASS_USER     | Email for Grass extension                      |
| GRASS_PASS     | Password for Grass extension                   |
| GRADIENT_EMAIL | Email for GradientNode extension               |
| GRADIENT_PASS  | Password for GradientNode extension            |
| DAWN_EMAIL     | Email for Dawn extension                       |
| DAWN_PASS      | Password for Dawn extension                    |
| TENO_EMAIL     | Email for Teno                                  |
| TENO_PASS     | Password for Teno                                |
| -v ./chrome_user_data:/chrome_user_data | Maps Chrome user data for session persistence |
| -p 5000:5000   | Exposes port 5000 for web-based interactions    |

### **Persistent Data Management**
To ensure session continuity across container restarts, DockWeb includes a volume mount for Chrome user data by default. This maps `./chrome_user_data` from the host system to `/chrome_user_data` within the container, enabling persistent storage and seamless session restoration.

## **Advanced Usage**

### **1. Pull the Docker Image:**
```bash
docker pull carbon2029/dockweb
```

### **2. Run the Container:**
Run the container while supplying credentials for one or more supported extensions:
```bash
docker run -d --env ALL_EMAIL=<your_email> --env ALL_PASS=<your_password> \
  --volume ./chrome_user_data:/chrome_user_data \
  --publish 5000:5000 carbon2029/dockweb
```

### **3. Monitor the Container:**
To verify if the container is running:
```bash
docker ps
```

### **4. Stop the Container:**
```bash
docker stop <container_id>
```
